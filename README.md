# draw__yolo_box_coordinates_on_image
In this repo, I wrote python script that take the output bounding box of  Yolo and the text, and then draw them on the image.

this happen by takung Yolo cooardinates (center_x, center_y,width,height) and convert it to be suitable to be used for drawing  rectangle on the image with the text above the rectangle.

 you can select bounding box on an image using "labelImg" and then get the output values to draw on the image

 You can Downliad labelImg from here:
